# CSCI 5622: Machine Learning
The varieties of red and white wine are increasing every year. The increased production and sales of wine make it harder for the consumer to purchase good quality wine.
In this machine learning project, wine-related datasets were collected to examine the properties and satisfaction associated with some red wines. 
Four datasets will primarly be utilized to perform data cleaning and visualization, unsupervised learning methods, and supervised learning methods.
Chemical analysis data will be used to examine the relationship between chemical composition influences on final consumer satisfaction.
Wine rating produced by the Wine Enthusiast include both text and numeric data which will be used to examine relationships between the red wine description and chemical composition with consumer satisfaction.
Specific wine data from Portugal present information on chemical composition and satisfaction. Lastly, news API data was also included to examine current information and public sentiment towards wine. 
The project will be divided into the following steps below. Writeup and codes associated with each step will be provided. 

1) Data Cleaning and Visualization
2) Unsupervised Methods: Clustering and Association Rule Mining
3) Supervised Methods: Decisions Trees, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines
